# Simple-Stack Compose FTUE Sample

Sample code using [simple-stack](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack/) and the [Compose integration](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack-compose-integration/) to display "First-Time User Experience", based on an older version of "Conditional Navigation" section of Jetpack Navigation documentation.

You can also see the same concept implemented using Simple-Stack (Fragments) in [the Simple-Stack FTUE sample](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack-ftue-sample/), or with Jetpack Navigation (Fragments) in [the Jetpack Navigation FTUE sample](https://github.com/Zhuinden/jetpack-navigation-ftue-sample/)).

There is also [Jetpack Navigation's Navigation-Compose FTUE sample](https://github.com/Zhuinden/jetpack-navigation-ftue-compose-sample) for comparison.
